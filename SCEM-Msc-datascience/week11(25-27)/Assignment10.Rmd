## Linear Discriminant analysis

#### Q1

Let's fit a Gaussian distribution to the data from each of the two classes.

Then we obtain a probabilistic model for the data. We can then use this probabilistic model to generate a rule based on the probability of the two classes.


#### Q2


```{r}
library(Stat2Data)
data(Hawks)

hawks_total<- Hawks %>%
  select(Weight,Wing,Hallux,Tail,Species)%>%
  filter(Species=='SS'|Species =='CH')%>%
  drop_na()%>%
  mutate(Species =as.numeric(Species=='SS'))
```


```{r}
