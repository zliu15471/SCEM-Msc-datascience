# Conditional probability, Bayes rule and independence

## Bayes theorem 

### Q1 

$$P(A) = 0.9\\
P(B|A) = 0.8\\
P(B^c|A^c) =0.75
$$
$$P(B) = P(B|A)*P(A) + P(B|A^c)*P(A^c)=P(B|A)*P(A) +[1-P(B^c|A^c)]*[1-P(A)] = 0.8*0.9+0.25*0.1 =0.745
$$
$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)*P(B|A)}{P(B)} = 0.9*0.8/0.745 = 0.966$$
