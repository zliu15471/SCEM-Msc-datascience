## 1.Probability theory 

### 1.1 Rules of probability 

#### Q1
P({a}) = 0.4
P({b}) = 0.1
P({c})=0.5

#### Q2 

rule 1: P(∅) = 0, since q ∈ [0,1], hence P({0}) = 1−q ≥ 0, P({1}) = q ≥ 0, P({0,1}) = 1 satisfy that P(A) ≥ 0 for any event A ∈ E
rule 2: Ω = {0,1} and P({0,1}) = 1 which satisfy P(Ω) = 1 for sample space Ω
rule 3: P({0}) = 1−q, P({1}) = q, P({0,1}) = 1 = P({0}) + P({1}) which satisfy rule 3.

### 1.2 Deriving new properties from the rules of probability

#### Q1 Union of a finite sequence of disjoint events
