```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## 1. Create a data frame

Run the following code in Console:
```{r}
animals <- c( "Snake", "Ostrich", "Cat", "Spider") # vector of city names
num_legs <- c(0, 2, 4, 8) # vector of populations
animals_df <-data.frame(animals,num_legs) # generating data frame
animals_df
```


## 2. Check and delete objects


## 3. Create a data frame in R Scripts

## 4. Create a data frame in R Markdown

Step 1. Insert a block of R code.
```{r}
animals <- c( "Snake", "Ostrich", "Cat", "Spider") # vector of city names
num_legs <- c(0, 2, 4, 8) # vector of populations
animals_df <-data.frame(animals,num_legs) # generating data frame
```

Step 2. Insert another block of code to print animals df.
```{r}
animals_df
```


## 5. Matrix operations
Use the seq() function to generate a sequence of numbers starting at 12 and decreasing to 2 in steps of -2.
```{r}
x_vect = seq(12,2,-2)
print(x_vect)
```

Now convert the vector x vect into a matrix (with 2 rows and 3 coloumns) called X, using the matrix() function
```{r}
X = matrix(x_vect, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
print(X)
```


Next create a 2 by 2 matrix called Y consisting of a sequence of four numbers from 1-4. The matrix Y should look like this
```{r}
Y = matrix(seq(4), 2, 2)
print(Y)
```



In addition, create another 2 by 2 matrix called Z which looks as follows:
```{r}
Z = matrix(c(4,6,8,10), 2,2)
print(Z)
```



Matrix sums. 
```{r}
print(Y+Z)
print(Z+Y)
```

Matrix multiplication.

```{r}
print(Y %*% X)
```

Matrix element-wise multiplication.
```{r}
print(Y*Z)
print(Z*Y)
```


**Answer** Element-wise multiplication is commutative. 


Matrix inverse. 

Compute the matrix inverse Y −1 via the solve() function:
```{r}
solve(Y)
```

Next, check what you get from computing $Y^{−1}Y$ in R.
```{r}
print(Y %*% solve(Y))
```

**Answer** It is an identity matrix. 

Now compute $Y^{−1}X$. Your result should look like this
```{r}
print(solve(Y) %*% X)
```

Can you do this without first computing $Y^−1$? Try running the help command on the solve() function by typing ?
```{r}
solve(Y, X)
```


## 6. Writing a function within R

You will need to create an R script and put in the following code:

Step 1.
Within your script create a short function called myFirstRFunc which takes in a single numerical argument n and outputs the sum of all those numbers strictly below n which are divisible by either 2 or 7 or both. 

```{r}
myFirstRFunc <- function(n){
  num <- 0
  for (i in 1:(n-1)){
    if (i%%2==0){
      num <- num + i
    } else if (i%%7==0){
      num <- num + i
    }
  }
  return (num)
}
```

```{r}
print(myFirstRFunc(1000))
```




## 7 Further R Markdown exercises

Step 1. Within your R markdown insert a section heading called “Wave plot. 

Here is the section heading:
# Wave plot

Step 2. Insert a code block to do the following.
```{r}
x = seq(0, 20, 0.01)
y = sin(x)
sin_df = data.frame(x,y)
head(sin_df,3)
```


```{r}
plot(sin_df)
```




Step 3. Insert the following mathematical formula into your Markdown file. 
\[
\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1
\]
