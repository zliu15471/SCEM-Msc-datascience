```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

you can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r simple vectors}
x <- c(3,7,4,2,1,2,-4,-5)
print(x+1)
```

Following another code chunk:

```{r build a function and a data frame}
# 1. create a function
func <- function(x){
  return (sin(x)+cos(x))
}
#2. call the function 
x = seq(from = 0, to = 2*pi, by = 0.05)
y = func(x)
#3. create a data frame
df = data.frame(x,y)
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plot the function, echo=FALSE}
# plot the dataframe
plot(df)
```
